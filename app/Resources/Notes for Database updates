when updating/changing database structure for this project
I must change bootstrap.php.

First I have uncomment the end:

   ConsoleRunner::run(
       new SingleManagerProvider($entityManager)
   );

Then after the update recomment it out:

    //ConsoleRunner::run(
    //    new SingleManagerProvider($entityManager)
    //);


I am not sure why, but that is how it works, and so I am noteing it now
